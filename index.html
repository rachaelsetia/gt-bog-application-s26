                    My name is Rachael Setia, and I'm from Raleigh, North Carolina! I'm a first year student 
                    majoring in Computer Science with the Intelligence and Media threads graduating in May 2028. 
                    I'm also pursuing a minor in Biology because of my interest in computational biology and 
                    bioinformatics. I'm also planning to do the BSMS program here at Georgia Tech!

                <p>
                    Since I was in middle school, I've always been involved in efforts to give back to my 
                    community and better it in any way that I can. In high school, I committed to doing this by 
                    volunteering at UNC Rex Hospital to help out the large workload of doctors and nurses, 
                    helping over 500 patients. I also volunteered at Second Chance Pet Adoptions, a local animal 
                    rescue with a mission to save animals on the euthanization list. In addition, I worked to spread 
                    my passion for STEM through the many outreaches that I prepared with my robotics team. 
                    We worked with local organizations and museums to participate in or host events that would expose 
                    the local community, especially children, to the wonders of STEM and its role in our future. 
                    I hope that, through Bits of Good, I can continue to serve my community as well as the organizations 
                    that support this community.
